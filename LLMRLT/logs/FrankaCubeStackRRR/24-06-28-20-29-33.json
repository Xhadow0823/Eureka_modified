    "content": "You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.\nYour goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. \nYour reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: \n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor, ...) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # initialize\n    reward = torch.zeros_like(...)\n    reward_components = {}\n\n    # this section compute the reward component for state 0\n    # === state 0 reward ===\n    approach_reward = ...   # this is a reward component for making agent approaching...\n    state0_reward = torch.where(FSM == 0, approach_reward, torch.zeros_like(...))\n\n    # this section compute the reward component for state 1\n    # === state 1 reward ===\n    close_gripper_reward = torch.tanh(temp_state_1 * -a_gripper)\n    state1_reward = torch.where(FSM == 1, close_gripper_reward, torch.zeros_like(...))\n    ...\n\n    # === BSR ===\n    BSR = FSM.to(torch.float)  # important: this BSR reward is needed for all task\n\n    # this section sum up all state reward components and BSR into total reward\n    reward = state0_reward + state1_reward + ... + BSR\n\n    # this section storage each state reward into the dict\n    reward_components[\"r/state0\"] = state0_reward.mean()  # note that the state reward is tensor, we have to do .mean() to turn it into float for storage in dict\n    reward_components[\"r/state1\"] = state1_reward.mean()\n    ...\n    reward_components[\"r/BSR\"] = BSR.mean()  # save BSR into reward_components dict is important\n\n    return reward, reward_components\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    + The whole task will be decompose into several \"sub-tasks\", and the reward function will be decompose into several sub-reward functions called \"sub-task reward components\".\n    + Each sub-task reward component is continuous and smooth, DO NOT use binary conditions or specific thresholds.\n    + Each sub-task reward component must range 0~1.\n    + The final reward is the sum of all sub-task reward components plus the BSR(Base Sub-task Reward).\n    + For certain tasks, additional rewards may be given upon reaching the final sub-task. The decision to give additional rewards should be based on the task description.\n    + Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor .\n    + Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

Please consider redesigning the reward functions for sub-tasks 1 through 6.\n    + Do not modify the BSR component.\n+ For the modifications of sub-tasks 1 through 6, here are some guidelines:\n    + If the minimum value of any sub-task reward is less than 0, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.\n    + If the maximum value of any sub-task reward is more than 1 and the sub-task is not the latest sub-task, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.\n    + If the sub-task reward of state n is always near zero, re-design the sub-task reward.\n+ For sub-tasks 0 through 0, please check for the following issues. If none of these issues are present, retain their design:\n    + If the minimum value of any sub-task reward is less than 0, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.\n    + If the maximum value of any sub-task reward is more than 1 and the sub-task is not the latest sub-task, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.\n+ Please infer the domain of the observations required to calculate the sub-task rewards based on the range of sub-task reward results in the evaluation result, and redesign the functions according to that domain to ensure the sub-task reward range is valid.\n+ Please redesign the sub-task reward according to the sub-task reward domain to ensure the reward range is valid, without using functions like clamp.\n+ Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward!\nThe output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    + The whole task will be decompose into several \"sub-tasks\", and the reward function will be decompose into several sub-reward functions called \"sub-task reward components\".\n    + Each sub-task reward component is continuous and smooth, DO NOT use binary conditions or specific thresholds.\n    + Each sub-task reward component must range 0~1.\n    + The final reward is the sum of all sub-task reward components plus the BSR(Base Sub-task Reward).\n    + For certain tasks, additional rewards may be given upon reaching the final sub-task.
