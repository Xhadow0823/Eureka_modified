Please carefully analyze the evaluation result and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
+ For the BSR(Base Sub-task Reward): 
	+ If the BSR are always near zero, rewrite the entire reward function.
	+ {BSR_analysis}
+ For the SR(Success Rate): 
	+ If the success rate(SR) are always near zero, rewrite the entire reward function.
	+ if the success rate(SR) can not reach 0.5, the user have to increase the task's max-epochs for evaluation.
+ For each sub-task reward(state n): 
	+ if sub-task reward of state n is always near zero, re-design the sub-task reward.
	+ If the min value of any sub-task reward is less than 0, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.
	+ if the max value of any sub-task reward is more than 1 and the sub-task is not the latest sub-task, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.
	+ Some sub-task reward component's magnitude is smaller then other reward components relatively, make the sub-task reward function more sensitive.
+ Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward!
