Please carefully analyze the evaluation result and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
+ For the SR (Success Rate): 
	+ If the success rate (SR) is always near zero, rewrite the entire reward function.
+ For the BSR (Base Sub-task Reward): 
	+ If the BSR is always near zero, rewrite the entire reward function.
    + In the evaluation, the highest achievable sub-task index is sub-task {highest_achievable_st}, while the last sub-task in the entire task is sub-task {last_st}. Please consider redesigning the reward functions for sub-tasks {highest_achievable_st} through {last_st}.
    + Do not modify the BSR component.
+ For the modifications of sub-tasks {highest_achievable_st} through {last_st}, here are some guidelines:
    + If the minimum value of any sub-task reward is less than 0, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.
    + If the maximum value of any sub-task reward is more than 1 and the sub-task is not the latest sub-task, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.
    + If the sub-task reward of state n is always near zero, re-design the sub-task reward base on the task description.
+ For sub-tasks 0 through {highest_achievable_st-1}, please check for the following issues. If none of these issues are present, RETAIN their design:
    + If the minimum value of any sub-task reward is less than 0, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.
    + If the maximum value of any sub-task reward is more than 1 and the sub-task is not the latest sub-task, the sub-task reward range is illegal. Modify the sub-task reward to range from 0 to 1.
    + Note that the latest sub-task reward do not have the limitation about range.
+ Please infer the domain of the observations required to calculate the sub-task rewards based on the range of sub-task reward results in the evaluation result, and redesign the functions according to that domain to ensure the sub-task reward range is valid.
+ Please redesign the sub-task reward according to the sub-task reward domain to ensure the reward range is valid, WITHOUT using functions like clamp.
+ Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward!
