This task is to make cube A stack on cube B using the end effector (gripper).
The task is decomposed into 7 sub-tasks.
The current sub-task index of each agent is stored in the variable "FSM" as a torch.Tensor.
The sub-task 0 (state0) requires the end effector to approach cube A.
The sub-task 1 (state1) requires the gripper to close as much as possible.
The sub-task 2 (state2) requires cube A to reach as high an altitude as possible.
The sub-task 3 (state3) requires the horizontal coordinates between cube A and cube B to be as close as possible.
The sub-task 4 (state4) requires cube A to be positioned directly above cube B at a distance of (cubeA_size + cubeB_size)/2. The closer, the better.
The sub-task 5 (state5) requires the end effector to open as much as possible.
The sub-task 6 (state6) represents the state where cube A is stacked on cube B, with a reward always equal to 5.
